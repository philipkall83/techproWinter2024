Download the latest Node.js installer from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Once the installation is complete, open your command prompt or terminal and `run npm -v` to verify the installation.

Using Homebrew: If you have Homebrew installed, use the following command to install Node.js and npm:

`brew install node`

Using package managers: Most Linux distributions have Node.js and npm available in their package repositories. Use your distribution's package manager to install them. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian:

`sudo apt install nodejs npm`
